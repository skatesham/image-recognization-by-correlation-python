## Recognize pattern in image with correlation


### Introduction
> "One image can say more then 1000 word"

For computer image are group of pixels or even bytes. 

Need to processing image for understand.

The simples method is correlation, using all pixels two image for get correlation number.  

Correlation is based on statistics.  

This could be use on controlled environment for machine learning.

### Experiement

Process the following image try to get the number contents.

With the example patterns:

> The result should be the string with the number on the image.

## Conclusion
Success, was possible recognize.

More waiting explanation.

Thanks.
